# Hot Dog or Not Hot Dog Hackathon ðŸŒ­

# Introduction
Welcome to the "Hot Dog or Not Hot Dog" hackathon! This unique competition draws inspiration from the famous TV show "Silicon Valley," where a fictional app determined whether a picture contained a hot dog or not. In this challenge, participants were tasked with crafting a custom machine learning model capable of classifying images as either "Hot Dog" or "Not Hot Dog." Beyond the playful premise, this hackathon delves into the fascinating realm of computer vision, where participants demonstrate their prowess in developing intricate image recognition systems.

# Approach
In this hackathon, I embarked on an exciting journey to construct an original image classification model, eschewing the conventional transfer learning approach. My methodology comprised several pivotal stages:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** To lay the foundation, I meticulously examined the Kaggle dataset. Comprising a diverse range of images featuring hot dogs and assorted objects, the dataset warranted careful preprocessing. I engaged in data augmentation, resizing, and normalization to enhance the model's adaptability to variations within the data.

2. **Model Architecture Design:** Rather than relying on pre-existing architectures, I took a novel approach by devising my own model from scratch. This decision granted me greater control over the model's architecture, enabling a more tailored solution for the task at hand. My custom model consisted of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, designed to capture intricate image features.

3. **Training and Validation:** With the custom model in place, I proceeded to split the dataset into training and validation subsets. Calibration of hyperparameters became a focal point, wherein I adjusted factors such as learning rates, batch sizes, and activation functions to optimize the model's performance. Rigorous validation allowed me to iterate and refine the model effectively.

4. **Performance Metrics and Optimization:** To gauge the model's efficacy, I harnessed diverse metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. By comprehensively assessing the model's performance, I fine-tuned it iteratively, striving to achieve a balanced classification outcome for both "Hot Dog" and "Not Hot Dog" classes.

# Conclusion
Participating in the "Hot Dog or Not Hot Dog" hackathon provided me with an invaluable learning experience. By opting for an original model design rather than relying on transfer learning, I gained profound insights into the intricacies of convolutional neural networks, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter optimization. While the final accuracy of 74% showcases the efficacy of my model, this hackathon serves as a testament to the potential and creativity within the field of machine learning. The journey not only underscored the practical importance of image classification but also emphasized the innovative and inventive facets of the discipline.
